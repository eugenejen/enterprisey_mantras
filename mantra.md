Contrary to belief of many new-age engineering shops; the utmost elegant
products must be built in a environment constricted by bureaucratic hurdles.
Not only does this does it prove that the product is fit enough for survival
for years to come, but also serves as ego re-enforcement of the involved
fiefdoms.

While it is true that, the more fiefdoms a change must clear before it is
declared viable, the better. There are diminishing returns. New-agers
strive for one, but its obvious that with only one there cannot be conflict.
Two is ofter sufficient, but our research shows; three is optimal. This mostly
comes down to optimization problem: maximum argument with minimal likely hood
to enact change.

The most naive observer might assume that all things equal a party trying to
enact change has equal footing with one trying to prevent it. But this is not
the case. Preventing change is more potent; as it can always lean back on the
certainty of the status quo. Any theory of enactor can be detracted by its
uncertainty (and thus risk). Quantitatively, one force of detractment slightly
exceeds two of enactment. And so with three fiefdoms one is guaranteed that
change can be stalemated with only one detractment.

The three fiefdoms are broken down by the following three roles:
 * Those who Control invention of the un-impelentable
 * Those with Knowledge to implement the un-inventable
 * Those with Access to unimplement the invented
The less general but more colloquial terminology is often along the lines of
Product, Development, and Operations.

Remember that the true elegance of the ACK Triangle is that while it takes
all three to achieve anything it takes only one to achieve nothing! It is for
this reason that the triangle is only depicted by three vertices and no
edges, the edges convey a sense of collaboration and possibility of achievement.
